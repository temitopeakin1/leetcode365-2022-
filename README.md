# leetcode365-2022-
This is my steady Leetcode solutions for 365days all through which i commenced on Janaury 1st 2022

I decided to push myself to solve a DSA question daily, to improve my data structures solving skills, I take at least one hour a day to solve the daily question even though i might not get an optimal solution to all problem, i actually try to comprehend new concepts that might be vague to me.

It actually helps my learning process and definitely will help others who are passionate about DSA's
I need fellow Devs and Engineers to make this better, to achieve optimal and better solutions. It's highly important that Solutions to the questions comes natural for every person in the tech space.
